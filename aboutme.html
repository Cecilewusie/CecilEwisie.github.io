      <p>
        My Name is Cecil, I am 24 years and seeking my degree online. Having a
        degree in Applied Technology online should be fun and most of all
        important since most of the things we would learn should include more
        research and internet based and I am so glad to have this opportunity to
        study here at BYUI.

        My new manager at work inspired us all to create a website for our
        company and I didnt participate much in this challenge due to my shallow
        knowlege on web design but now I am so excited because I will get the
        chance learn new things and also add value to myself.

        I have been a member of the church of jesus of christ of latter day
        saints and I am so proud of the educational system our heavenly father
        has blessed us with.
